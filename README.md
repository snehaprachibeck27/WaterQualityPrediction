# WaterQualityPrediction
This project aims to predict multiple water quality parameters using machine learning techniques, specifically MultiOutputRegressor wrapped around a RandomForestRegressor. It was developed as part of a one-month AICTE Virtual Internship sponsored by Shell in June 2025.
# Overview
Access to clean water is a critical global concern. Accurate prediction of various water quality metrics can help in early detection of pollution and ensure timely intervention.

In this project, we:

. Collected and preprocessed real-world water quality datasets
. Used supervised machine learning for multi-target regression
. Built a pipeline using MultiOutputRegressor with RandomForestRegressor
. Evaluated the model using appropriate regression metrics
